Using the "PhoBERT" model for multi-label sentiment analysis on the TikTok comment dataset.

In this project, we leverage the power of the 'PhoBERT' model, a Vietnamese version of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, for conducting multi-label sentiment analysis on the TikTok comment dataset. We have constructed a TikTok comment dataset by collecting, preprocessing, and labeling emotions. Our dataset consists of comments that have been preprocessed and normalized into standard Vietnamese language form and have been assigned appropriate emotion labels from the label set designed for the multi-label model, which includes 8 emotion labels, comprising 3 basic labels (positive, negative, neutral) and 5 extended labels (toxic, confused, funny, admirable, compassionate).

Our goal is to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models that can accurately classify the sentiments expressed in TikTok comments. This analysis will help us gain insights into the emotions and opinions of TikTok users, contributing to a better understanding of the platform's content and user engagement.
